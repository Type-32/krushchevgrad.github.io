1. I did well on sticking the buildings together, so the painting group can paint.  I also didn’t make a lot of mess, I focus on my job very concentrated. My effort help the project move faster, so we can finish the project before the due date. 
2. By sticking more and more buildings together and let the painting group paint it, speed up the group pace.Also making sure the painting group have some work to work on, having everyone a job to do.  
3. I feel pretty excited about it, working in a 10 people group, its an experience that I’ve never had. Also, design and make a city is something that I never tried before, so I think it’s a good chance to try it out.  
4. The project didn’t went out at the beginning, not much people work, but at the middle towards end period, most of us thrives to get a job and contribute into this project, people collaborate with each other, wanting to finish the project before the school year end.
