1. I worked with the group leader and others to build several buildings. The pyramids and the triangular houses were all buildings that I cut myself and then Felix helped glue.
2. I replaced these buildings with white space (but there are still some gaps)
3. I think it's still interesting, but I feel a little overwhelmed, it takes a lesson to build a building, and the materials are a little less, and the pigments are in short supply.
4. The city is a bit of a mess; At first, I was confident, but then I didn't have as much motivation. Some people stand by while we work and don't do anything meaningful. There were a dozen people in our group, but the actual work could be done by four or five people... This project was planned twice, the first time using clay as a material, and later found to be completely unworkable; But when it comes to re-planning, there is not a lot of time left.
